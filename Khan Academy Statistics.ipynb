    "Answer: The probability of you picking 2 green marbles in a row is $\\frac{3}{5}*\\frac{2}{4}$ since the second probability is altered by you picking one marble. The probability is thus $\\frac{12}{20}*\\frac{10}{20}=\\frac{120}{400}=\\frac{3}{10}=0.3$. So every time you play, your expected profit is \\$0.3, whereas your bet is \\$0.35, which means you're loosing money in the long run."
